    question: <span>Is Courier only for engineering teams?</span>,
    answer: (
      <p>
        Not at all! While Courier is built with engineering teams in mind, a key
        benefit that Courier provides is empowering non-engineers with the
        ability to configure your product&lsquo;s notification strategy and build or
        customize messages across all of your channels &mdash; without needing
        an engineer to be involved.

    question: (
      <span>
        Do I have to switch from my current provider? e.g. Twilio, SendGrid,
        etc.
      </span>
    ),
    answer: (
      <p>
        No. Courier routes notifications to the best provider, but does not
        deliver the actual notification. Keep your existing providers and add
        your API keys into Integrations panel in the Courier administration UI.

    question: <span>How do I talk to someone who works at Courier?</span>,
