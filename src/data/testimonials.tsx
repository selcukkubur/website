        At Winmore we've built communication tools for the world's largest
        logistics companies. Our users are always on-the-go, so notifications
        are critical for us â€“ but we've never been able to get our multi-channel
        strategy to work as well as we'd like. Wish we'd had{' '}

        We're just getting started on our first product here at Outer Labs.{' '}
        <strong>Courier</strong> made it simple to add our very first user
        notifications and we're excited to know that there is a lot more power
        waiting for us when we need it.
        <br />
        <br />
        The open source <em>UI Kit</em> was especially helpful &mdash; we were
        able to skip right past re-building the same notification UI we've had
        to recreate so many times in the past.

        Flock was built mobile-first, so we've always focused on mobile push
        notifications. Now that we have added our first web app, we've realized
        that just adding one more channel is a lot more work than you'd think.{' '}
        <strong>Courier</strong> lets us just forget about notifications and get
        back to focusing on our core product.
