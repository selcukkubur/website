            Lattice keeps managers and teams connected and focused on their
            goals with multi-channel notifications (Slack, Microsoft Teams,
            email and mobile push) powered by Courier.

          “We were building out a new team to focus entirely on our
          notification infrastructure when we found Courier. Now we support
          even more channels with one line of code – and our product managers
          & designers can design the templates without engineering help.”
