    <Heading>Right User</Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      Ensuring that your notifications are going out to the right user is table
      stakes. Ensuring that your user events are properly wired up with the
      relevant data associated with them is the most important piece to getting
      this right.
    </Paragraph>
    <Example>
      If a new user is added to the account of a B2B SaaS app, should the
      billing admin be notified? How about the other admins? You need to ensure
      that your events are properly wired so that this single sign-up event can
      trigger any relevant notifications and include the relative data to that
      notification.
    </Example>
    <Heading>Right Message</Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      The user needs to be in control of ensuring they only get the
      notifications that they care about and through their preferred channel(s).
      It’s your job as the developer to provide sane defaults to make this job
      easy on the user.
    </Paragraph>
    <Example>
      If your application has 25 different possible notifications, don’t ask the
      user to toggle each one of those on/off plus set channel preferences.
      Rather, you should group them into logical groups and then allow the user
      to decide when and how they want to receive each group of notifications.
    </Example>
    <Heading>Right Frequency</Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      Notifications that are too frequent annoy users and hurt engagement.
      However, missing an essential notification can potentially ruin the
      utility of a product for a user.
    </Paragraph>
    <Example>
      When you get five messages while you are away on Slack, Slack does not
      send you five notifications. Rather it batches those five notifications
      into a single ‘While you were away’ notification. Your system should have
      the ability to batch notifications in order to avoid over-notifying users
      and should have access to all relevant events in order to make sure your
      user’s don’t miss anything important.
    </Example>
    <Heading>Right Channel</Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      The channel requirements for each product will differ depending on the
      user’s preferred communication methods. No matter what channels you need
      to support, your notification system needs the flexibility to respect your
      user’s preferences and deliver each type of notification to the channel of
      choice for each individual user. You should also design your system with
      the flexibility to support other channels in the future that you may not
      need today.
    </Paragraph>
    <Example>
      Your users may want to receive certain notifications over email only,
      others over email + Slack, and still others over Slack only. You should
      make sure this is easy to customize while providing sane defaults to start
      out.
    </Example>
    <Heading>Right Time</Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      Timing is perhaps the most important aspect of delivering effective
      notifications. A well timed notification delights users, while a poorly
      timed one annoys or angers them. Your notification system needs the
      flexibility to adjust sends based on the time of day where your user is,
      the actions your user has taken, and the relevant job your user is trying
      to achieve.
    </Paragraph>
    <Example>
      A B2B IT management application sends an admin an email when a user
      requests permission to create a new Slack channel. If there is no response
      within 2 business days, it follows up with a Slack notification to that
      admin during business hours. If another 2 business days pass with no
      response, it sends another email to both the admin and the requester
      notifying them that the request has expired without being granted.
    </Example>
